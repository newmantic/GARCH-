# GARCH

The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is a popular statistical model used in finance to estimate the volatility of financial time series data, such as stock returns. The model captures the tendency of volatility to cluster over time, meaning that large changes in prices are often followed by large changes, and small changes by small changes.

The GARCH model assumes that the current period's variance (volatility) depends on:
The previous period's variance (GARCH term).
The previous period's squared return (ARCH term).

GARCH(1,1) Model
The most common form of the GARCH model is the GARCH(1,1) model, which can be described mathematically as follows:


Return Process:
r_t = mu + epsilon_t
Where:
r_t is the return at time t.
mu is the mean return (often assumed to be zero in many applications).
epsilon_t is the error term, which represents the unpredictable part of the return.

Error Term (Residual):
epsilon_t = sigma_t * z_t
Where:
sigma_t is the conditional standard deviation (volatility) at time t.
z_t is a white noise error term with mean zero and variance one, typically z_t ~ N(0, 1).

Conditional Variance Equation:
sigma_t^2 = omega + alpha * epsilon_{t-1}^2 + beta * sigma_{t-1}^2
Where:
sigma_t^2 is the conditional variance at time t.
omega is a constant term.
alpha is the coefficient of the lagged squared residual (epsilon_{t-1}^2), also known as the ARCH term.
beta is the coefficient of the lagged variance (sigma_{t-1}^2), also known as the GARCH term.

omega (omega): This is the long-term average level of variance. It represents the base level of volatility in the absence of any new information.

alpha (alpha): This measures the impact of the previous period's squared return (shock) on the current period's variance. If alpha is large, recent shocks have a significant impact on current volatility.

beta (beta): This measures the persistence of volatility. If beta is large, volatility tends to be persistent, meaning that high volatility periods will be followed by high volatility periods.


Stationarity Condition: For the GARCH(1,1) model to be stationary (i.e., the variance does not explode), the sum of alpha and beta should be less than 1:
alpha + beta < 1

Volatility Clustering: The model captures the phenomenon where large changes in returns are followed by large changes, and small changes are followed by small changes.

Leverage Effect: While the standard GARCH(1,1) model does not account for the leverage effect (where volatility tends to increase more after negative returns than after positive returns), it can be extended to do so by using models like the GJR-GARCH or EGARCH models.


GARCH models are used to estimate and forecast volatility, which is crucial for risk management, particularly in calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and other risk measures. Volatility forecasts from GARCH models are used in the pricing of options and other derivative securities. GARCH models are a standard tool in financial econometrics for modeling time series data that exhibit volatility clustering.
